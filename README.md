# Using SHAP Values for Clustering-based Bias Identification
In this repo, you can find the code for our paper "Using SHAP Values for Clustering-based Bias Identification."

We study whether including SHAP values as input features to clustering methods can be beneficial for bias identification. 

Using the COMPAS dataset, we experiment with three clustering methods that can be embedded within HBAC: K-means, K-Prototypes, and DBSCAN. 

# Getting started
Use the Compas_error_shap.csv dataset to run the code for all clustering methods (K-Means, K-Prototypes, DBSCAN).
